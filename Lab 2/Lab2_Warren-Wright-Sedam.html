		Computing and computer technology are part of just about everything that touches our lives...Computing drives innovation in the sciences (human genome project, AIDS vaccine research, environmental monitoring and protection just to mention a few), and also in engineering, business, entertainment and education. If you want to make a positive difference in the world, study computing. ...Computing jobs are among the highest paid and have the highest job satisfaction. ...Expertise in computing helps you even if your primary career choice is something else.
